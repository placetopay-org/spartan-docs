# Know us {#getting-started}

The most important thing for us is that our work team understands who we are and that each element, each product reflects our brand.

Spartan, is created to make efficient design management. It empowers our team so that the final product complies with the design standards of the company and we reach the client in the effective and appropriate way.

The design system will allow the team to create simple or complex components in a clear and consistent way. In turn, the process of designing and prototyping will be more agile.

## Our own spark

As a brand we have our own personality and tone, this helps to distinguish ourselves from other brands and to reach customers the way we want.
